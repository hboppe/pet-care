# Pet Care API

This is a CRUD application built with Django that enables the creation of new pets, their characteristics, and their breeds by scientific name.

This API ensures that breed and trait names are not created more than once. If you create a pet and the trait/breed associated with it is already in the database, that existing trait/breed will be linked to your pet.
